## Summary

An immersive list now built on [Krentorran v1.1.0](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/119972) with some prefered modifications. A **No Frills** Requiem list going back to the basics for a simple experience. Focusing on small immersive additions instead of major content for a vanilla style feel with increased difficulty Viir Su'um is back!

<summary><h2>Installation</h2></summary>

### Pre-Installation
For the Installation of Viir Su'um you must use the most recent version of Skyrim Anniversary Edition on steam and download all free Creation Club content **AND** the newest creation kit. 

**This is only a requirment for the first install not when updating.**

#### Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package

 Please make sure you have the latest Visual C++ installed. 
 [Direct link](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) 

#### Cleaning Skyrim

Please uninstall Skyrim/CK through Steam and delete the documents folder typically located at "Drive"\Documents\My Games\Skyrim Special Edition. Once this is finished you may reinstall Skyrim/CK.
**(This list uses a stock game folder and will download the correct versions of all files)**

#### Starting Skyrim

After Reinstalling Skyrim make sure to run the Game atleast once for the Graphics Check, hit play, and load the game to the main menu. Once at the main menu allow all the Creation Club content to download before closing and starting Wabbajack.

### Wabbajack

#### Preparations

Download the latest version of Wabbajack [here](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/releases) and place the `Wabbajack.exe` file in a folder when unzipping at a root location such as **C:\Wabbajack** (This is the recommended installation method according to the wiki)

#### Download and Installation

The Process itself can take a while to speed this up you can put all files on an SSD (This is the reccomened and intended installation method for Dying Breath anyway.)

_STILL WRITING INSTRUCTIONS FOR HOW TO INSTALL WITH WABBAJACK_

**(These are from the [WIKI](https://wiki.wabbajack.org/user_documentation/Installing%20a%20Modlist.html))**

    Open Wabbajack and Navigate to the Gallery
    Decide on a List to install
    Click the download button
    Wait for the first download of the .wabbajack file to finish
    When it is done click the play button where previously you had the download button
    Open and read the specific readme of the list you are about to install
    Download any third-party or external files before attempting to install the list
    Select the paths for where the list should be installed
        Installation Location: The location where the files required to play will be installed to
            Can't be set to Wabbajack's Location
            Can't be set to Game Location
            Can't be the same as another list (lists can't be merged)
            Can't be in a Windows OS managed folder (Examples include Program Files, Downloads, and the Desktop)
    Download Location: The location where the downloaded archives are stored.
        Can share the same location as the downloads folders of other lists (avoids duplicate downloads)
        Don't merge download locations if you plan to create and share your own modlists, because Wabbajack can't really differentiate which archives are the ones it needs and which just have similar files.
    Wait till Wabbajack is done
    Go back to the readme (which will open automatically) and complete any final steps mentioned there


#### Problems with Wabbajack

If you recieve lots of errors while downloading please relogin to Nexus through wabbajack and restart the application before requesting support from anywhere.

#### Could not download...

If you have issues with files not downloading, manually download the files and drop them inside of the Download folder, then re-run Wabbajack. When Wabbajack detects the correct file it will resume installation. 

#### Files with known download issues

None Currently (_if you identify one please create a post in the discord support channel_)
